# Blinking-LEDs-without-programming
Blinking Two LEDs Using Transistors The circuit for blinking an LED using transistors is called an Astable Multivibrator.

To understand this circuit you need to know how voltages and currents behave around resistors, capacitors and diodes.
Hereâ€™s an overview of what happens:
The two capacitors C1 and C2 will alternate between being charged and discharged and thereby turning the transistors ON and OFF. When a transistor is ON it allows current to flow through it so that the LED above it will light up.
